## Info
Updated August 29, 2022

The Minecraft server is running on 1.19 because I have been too lazy to update it. (There is a technical reason for that too that I am working on.)
Some known issues are that skins don't work except for when they do and pets won't sit down except for when they do. Those are probably my bad.
Also the internet at my house turns off at 9:30pm except on Fridays it turns off at 10:00pm, so it is unavalible at night.
Also there are a few optimization mods installed and also *Simple Voice Chat* of Hermitcraft fame.
There is probably more stuff I should tell you about, but that's all I can think of at the moment. Like fire tick is disabled, and probably something else too.

Happy Mining, Crafting, and Building
